Idle Master Extended by [JonasNilson](https://github.com/JonasNilson).<br>
Idle Master was created by [jshackles](https://github.com/jshackles), based on the original code created by Stumpokapow.
Idle Master was written in `C#` using `Steamworks.NET` and [`CSteamworks`](https://github.com/rlabrecque/CSteamworks), and using open source icons from [Open Iconic](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic).
